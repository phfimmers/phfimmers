### Hi I'm Philippe,  
### Welcome to my GitHub,

I started coding python in 2020 for practicing data science, but I think I was looking for a reason to code much longer.  
You'll find group projects here done through my training. <br>If you see something about Formula 1, that will be my personal project.
